Firstly, for performance optimization, I would conduct a thorough audit of your site to identify any bottlenecks or issues. This could include checking for slow loading pages, broken links, or unoptimized images that might be slowing down your site. After identifying these issues, I would implement necessary changes such as compressing images, optimizing your code, and leveraging browser caching.

In terms of SEO, I would start by conducting keyword research to identify the terms your potential customers are using to find services or products similar to yours. From there, I would optimize your website's content and meta tags to better align with these keywords. I would also work on improving your site's backlink profile, as backlinks from reputable sites can greatly improve your SEO.

In addition, I would also ensure your website is mobile-friendly, as this is an important ranking factor for SEO. I would also set up an analytics program for your website if you don't have one already, so you can track your site's performance and make data-driven decisions.

This is just a broad overview of how I could help. The exact strategies and steps would depend on your specific website and business needs.</p></div><div class="audit audit-high"><h3># Agent: QC Auditor Agent</h3><p><strong>Final Score: 95</strong></p><p>Given the above analysis, I would rate this response a 95 out of 100.
