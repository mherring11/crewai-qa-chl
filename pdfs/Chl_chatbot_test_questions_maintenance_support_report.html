Next, we develop a roadmap for resolving these issues. This includes creating a timeline for fixes, allocating resources, and setting milestones for progress checks. 

During the actual maintenance process, it's important to maintain regular communication with stakeholders to keep them informed about our progress and any potential delays or complications. 

Additionally, implementing a robust testing strategy is crucial. Each fix should be tested in a controlled environment before it's deployed to the live site to ensure it doesn't introduce new issues. 

Lastly, once the immediate issues are resolved, it's vital to establish a long-term maintenance plan. This includes regular audits, updates, and proactive measures to prevent future problems. This way, we can ensure the website remains functional, up-to-date, and secure.</p></div><div class="audit audit-high"><h3># Agent: QC Auditor Agent</h3><p><strong>Final Score: 95</strong></p><p>Based on its relevance, accuracy, and clarity, the given answer scores 95 out of 100.

This includes conducting a thorough analysis of the current systems to identify any gaps or shortcomings that could be addressed with new technology. Once potential solutions have been identified, it's crucial to develop a detailed implementation plan that includes timelines, responsibilities, and contingency plans in case of unforeseen issues. 

The implementation of new technologies should be done gradually to avoid potential disruptions to the operation of the current systems. It's also essential to provide adequate training and support to all users to ensure a smooth transition. 

Budget considerations are also a key factor in this balance. It's important to ensure that the cost of maintaining the current systems does not prohibit the implementation of beneficial new technologies. 

Finally, it's crucial to continually monitor and evaluate the performance of both the current systems and the new technologies. This allows for adjustments and improvements to be made as needed, ensuring that the business continues to operate effectively and efficiently.</p></div><div class="audit audit-high"><h3># Agent: QC Auditor Agent</h3><p><strong>Final Score: 95</strong></p><p>This answer deserves a score of 95/100.
