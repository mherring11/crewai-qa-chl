By ensuring that your site is accessible, you are also expanding your potential audience to include users with disabilities, which could lead to an increase in traffic. 

Additionally, search engines like Google are increasingly considering accessibility as a ranking factor. Thus, by improving your site's accessibility, you are also likely to improve its search engine rankings, thereby increasing its online visibility. 

Finally, an accessible site can improve your brand's reputation and user satisfaction, which can indirectly boost your SEO and online visibility. In conclusion, improving your site's accessibility is a strategic move that can yield significant benefits for your SEO and online visibility.</p></div><div class="audit audit-high"><h3># Agent: QC Auditor Agent</h3><p><strong>Final Score: 95</strong></p><p>Based on the criteria of relevance, accuracy, and clarity, I would score the simulated response a 95 out of 100.
